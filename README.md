# ðŸŽ“ Predicting College Interest
## Description

The College Interest Prediction project analyzes various features to determine what factors influence students' interest in attending college. By applying KNN and Random Forest classifiers, and enhancing accuracy with `train_test_split` and `OneHotEncoder`, we achieved a maximum accuracy of 55%. Key factors influencing interest include house area, average grades, parent salary, and parent age.

## Key Technologies Used

- **Data Analysis**: Pandas for data manipulation and analysis of college interest factors.
- **Machine Learning**: 
  - **KNN Classifier**: Used for classification based on student interest levels.
  - **Random Forest Classifier**: Improved accuracy by combining multiple decision trees.
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - **`train_test_split`**: Splits dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
  - **`OneHotEncoder`**: Encodes categorical features to prepare data for classification.

## Purpose

The project aims to identify key features affecting high school students' interest in college, using machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.
